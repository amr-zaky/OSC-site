        <h4>Linux Distribution Party (LDP)</h4>
         <p>
         Previously known as "Ubuntu Release Party", it is an event that is hosted twice per year. 
         The purpose of the event is to introduce students to Linux and free software by giving them 
         the chance to try several Linux distributions. They can also choose to have Linux installed 
         on their laptops alongside Windows or take the installation media on a flash drive.

    <h4>
    Workshops
    </h4>
    <p>
    An event in which we provide 3 workshops 
        Linux,Blender and Laravel The workshopsâ€™ instructors are students 
        with knowledge vast enough to put the applicants on the right path.
        The workshops are completely free, they start at level zero and build up 
        until participants have enough information to follow their own path. 
        We also follow up with them through our public groups, and facebook fan page.

 <h4> Recruitment</h4>
  <p>
An event in which we open our gate for the students to join OSC and 
learn various skills. We explain the structure of OSC (as on the inside 
we are 4 families containing 12 committees), and then our Human Resources 
place the applicants where they fit best, once in you can work everywhere 
and learn from everybody.

    <h4>
    Sala5ana
    </h4>
    <p>
       
    It's a one day event where we invite our fellow students 
    to work with us as if they were OSC members, each committee 
    displays their work and lets people join in, this way people 
    learn and have fun as the day is also themed; we have games and 
    activities related to each committee, participants play to earn 
    Mohsens (The OSC currency) and at the end of the day the one with 
    the most number of Mohsens gets a present. The purpose of this day 
    is that instead of telling them, we show them what we do, how we do it, 
    and what it means to be an OSCian.
